Initial upload to GitHub. tephra2 is a tephra dispersion model based on an anylitical (closed-form) solution of the advection-diffusion equation. This initial version uses a plume model based on the beta function and incorporates a 2-D wind model that varies in speed and direction with changes in elevation.
